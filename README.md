At [@machinalis](https://twitter.com/machinalis) we have the

with the rest must write a "+1" on the IRC to be counted.

This project aims to simplify the calculation of costs and determine
who pays how much.
It has been [forked](https://github.com/dmoisset/almuerzomatic) from 
an example angular app that @dmoisset made for learning purposes.
I've simply added an easy way to share the meal costs without requiring 
a server for that.
